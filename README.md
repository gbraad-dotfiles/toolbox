> [!NOTE]
> This image is based on my [gbraad-devenv/fedora](https://github.com/gbraad-devenv/fedora) image, and is therefore personalized;
> it uses  `gbraad` as user with my [dotfiles](https://github.com/gbraad/dotfiles) and tailored to use services exposed by my [homelab](https://github.com/gbraad-homelab) setup.

## Usage

The container can be used with [`devbox`](https://github.com/gbraad-dotfiles/#devbox) functions.
